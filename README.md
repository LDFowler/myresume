LaToya
Professionally: graduated from NuCamp Boot Camp as a Full Stack Developer. I am enjoying learning to code and build things that work. I am currently in the Python, AWS, SQL and DevOps program at NuCamp and learning to write clean code while also working on my AWS Cloud Security Practioner Certification. In my free time I love to read comics, travel, find Ramen restaurants and craft with my hands.
